## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For layout and responsiveness


### Continued Development

For future projects, I plan to continue improving my proficiency in responsive design, especially in creating layouts that look great on all screen sizes. I also aim to dive deeper into JavaScript to add more interactivity to my projects.

### Useful Resources

- [CSS-Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand Flexbox better and how to use it effectively.
- [MDN Web Docs: CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This resource was invaluable in learning about CSS Grid and its properties.
